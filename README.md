# Corgnito
Welcome! 

At corgnito, users hover the colorful circles to reveal the image in-corgnito. Corgnito.tech brings calmness and a piece of mind to its users by revealing them beautiful images.

## Inspiration

Our inspiration was koalatothemax.com

## Why "corgnito.tech"?

One of our teammates really like corgis so we had to appease her, but the main reason for the word corgnito is because all the corgi pictures are in-corgnito until users drag their mouse and reveal the image

## What it does

Some corgi are in-corgnito, users must drag their mouse above the dots displayed on the website to view the hidden image

## How we built it

corgnito.tech was built using javascript, html and css. The domain name is registered through domain.com and hosted using a s3bucket through amazon's AWS services.

## Challenges we ran into

BUGS, BUGS, AND MORE BUGS. Getting the mouse to interact with the canvas was especially difficult.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

It works correctly and runs quickly. As far as we can tell it is currently bug free.

## What we learned

New programming languages. How to host a website. Sleeping is important.

## What's next for corgnito.tech

Next, we hope to add a user interface to be more interactive to first time users and include features that allow users to submit/use their own images

## Built With

css, html, and javascript
we also used domain.com for domain name as well as R3 buckets from AWS to host the website

GO check it out!
