# corgnito.tech
Welcome! 

Inspiration
Our inspiration was koalatothemax.com

Why "corgnito.tech"?
One of our teammates really like corgis so we had to appease her, but the main reason for the word corgnito is because all the corgi pictures are in-corgnito until users drag their mouse and reveal the image

What it does
Some corgi are in-corgnito, users must drag their mouse above the dots displayed on the website to view the hidden image

How we built it
corgnito.tech was built using javascript, html and css. The domain name is registered through domain.com and hosted using a s3bucket through amazon's AWS services.

Challenges we ran into
BUGS, BUGS, AND MORE BUGS. Getting the mouse to interact with the canvas was especially difficult.

Accomplishments that we're proud of
It works correctly and runs quickly. As far as we can tell it is currently bug free.

What we learned
New programming languages. How to host a website. Sleeping is important.

What's next for corgnito.tech
Next, we hope to add a user interface to be more interactive to first time users and include features that allow users to submit/use their own images

Built With
css, html, and javascript
